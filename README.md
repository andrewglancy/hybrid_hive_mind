# Hybrid Hive Mind

This repository contains a structured framework for collaborative workshops and knowledge sharing sessions that explore how small groups, amplified by AI, can create faster, dream bigger, and build more fluidly.

## Purpose

The Hybrid Hive Mind repository serves as a centralized knowledge base and collaboration framework for teams working in hybrid environments. It addresses several key challenges:

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures and structures insights from workshops and collaborative sessions
- **Consistent Process**: Provides standardized templates and structures for running effective workshops
- **Remote Collaboration**: Supports teams working across different locations and time zones
- **Continuous Learning**: Facilitates the documentation and sharing of lessons learned
- **Scalable Framework**: Enables teams to replicate successful workshop formats and adapt them to different contexts

## Philosophy

This project is built on the belief that AI is not merely a faster tool, but a:
- **Pacing companion** that helps maintain momentum and flow
- **Chimeric reflection** that mirrors and expands our thinking
- **Strange attractor** that draws out new patterns of thought

We emphasize:
- **Experimentation** over perfection
- **Co-creation** between humans and AI
- **Reflection** on the process of thinking together
- **Playful exploration** of new ways of working

## Project Structure

Read more about the workshop structure on the [workshop Welcome.md page](./workshop_templates/00_Workshop_Overview/Welcome.md).

### Root Directory
- `workshops/` - Contains individual workshop sessions
- `workshop_templates/` - Contains template structures and resources for workshops

### Workshop Templates (`workshop_templates/`)
The templates directory is organized into numbered sections for different aspects of the workshop process:

- `00_Workshop_Overview/` - General workshop planning and overview materials
- `01_Brainstorms/` - Templates and resources for brainstorming sessions
- `02_Projects/` - Project planning and management templates
- `03_Prompts_and_Techniques/` - Various prompts and techniques for workshop facilitation
- `04_Lessons_Learned/` - Templates for documenting lessons learned
- `05_Obstacles_and_Solutions/` - Resources for addressing challenges
- `_Templates/` - Base templates for various workshop components
- `99_Scratchpad/` - Space for temporary or experimental content

### Workshops (`workshops/`)
This directory contains individual workshop sessions, each in its own dated directory (e.g., `04_27_2025_example/`). Each workshop directory follows the structure defined in the templates.

## Usage
1. Use the templates in `workshop_templates/` to plan and structure new workshops
2. Create new workshop directories in the `workshops/` folder using the date format YY_MM_DD_description
3. Follow the template structure to maintain consistency across workshops

## Contributing
When adding new content:
- Follow the existing directory structure
- Use the templates as a starting point
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document any new templates or structures added
