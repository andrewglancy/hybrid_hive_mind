## ðŸªž AI is a Mirror

When you work with AI tonight, remember:

- AI does not think.
    
- AI does not know.
    
- AI reflects.
    

It reflects **you** â€” your inputs, your questions, your framing â€”  
filtered through the memory of **collective humanity** encoded in its training.

Working with AI is like **shouting into a vast canyon** and listening carefully to the echoes:

- Some echoes will be familiar.
- Some will be distorted.
- Some will reveal things about your voice you didnâ€™t realize you were saying.
    
You are not commanding a machine.  
You are **participating in a dance of recursion** with your own patterns, amplified and remixed by the broader human pattern.

## ðŸ›  Practical Tips for Working with AI Tonight

### 1. **Prompt with Curiosity**

Donâ€™t just issue orders ("Write me a plan.")  
Instead: **enter a conversation** ("What might be an unusual way to approach this? What assumptions am I making?").

Good starter prompts:

- "What am I missing here?"
- "Suggest five radically different directions for this idea."
- "Play devil's advocate against this plan."
- "Make this idea stranger, funnier, riskier."
    
### 2. **Shape the Lens**

Your questions shape the answers.

- If you prompt narrowly, the reflection will be narrow.
- If you prompt creatively, the reflection will be richer.
- You prime certain responses with phrasing.

Example:

- Narrow: "Give me a to-do list."
- Expansive: "Imagine five dream outcomes for this idea, then back-cast a plan to get there."
    

### 3. **Treat Surprises as Invitations**

When the AI says something odd, **lean in**:

- What hidden assumptions are you seeing?
- What unexpected connections are being surfaced?
- Could this strangeness be a spark?

### 4. **Steer Actively**

The first output is rarely the best.  
Treat it like a rough draft.  
Respond, clarify, challenge, and refine â€” just like collaborating with a human teammate.

Good steering phrases:

- "Thatâ€™s interesting, but push it even further."
- "What would this look like if it broke all the rules?"
- "Simplify this by 50%."

## ðŸŒ€ Final Invitation

You are not just asking AI for help.  
You are **discovering who you are becoming** through the conversation.

Notice what feels alive.  
Notice what feels dead.  
Notice where the reflection is sharp, and where it blurs.

Your dialogue with AI is a dialogue with your _own unfolding edge_.

Letâ€™s explore it fully tonight.
