# Project Title

## ðŸš€ What We Built
> Briefly describe the idea or prototype you created.
> (1â€“3 sentences max.)

**Example:**  
"A web app that uses AI to suggest weird weekend activities based on your mood."

---

## ðŸ§  How We Used AI
> How did AI assist you?  
> (Brainstorming, planning, coding, design, writing, refactoring, etc.)

**Example:**  
- Brainstormed five different app concepts
- Helped prioritize features based on novelty
- Wrote first drafts of UI copy

---

## ðŸŽ¨ What Surprised Us
> Did AI suggest something unexpected?  
> Did something weird, funny, or profound happen?

**Example:**  
"We asked for strange ideas and got 'volunteering with ghost tours,' which led to a whole new app theme."

---

## ðŸ”¥ Highlights + Struggles
> What flowed easily?  
> Where did you get stuck (with AI or without)?

**Example:**  
- Flow: Generating variations on signup flows
- Struggle: AI outputs for serious topics felt too generic until we asked for 'emotional nuance'

---

## ðŸ›¤ If We Had More Time...
> What would be your next steps?

**Example:**  
- Build a quick MVP and test it with 5 real users
- Refine matching algorithm with more emotional prompts

---

## ðŸŒ€ Reflections on Human + AI Collaboration
> What did it *feel* like to co-create with AI?  
> Any shifts in how you thought, worked, or made decisions?

**Example:**  
"AI acted like a mirror that exaggerated our first instincts. Best results came when we challenged its suggestions, not when we just accepted them."
